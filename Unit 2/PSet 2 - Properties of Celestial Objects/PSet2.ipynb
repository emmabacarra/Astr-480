    "## Problem Set 2 - Properties of Celestial Objects\n",
    "One of the challenging parts of designing and executing a research project is differentiating between the results of data (our measurements), and a connection to physical properties of astronomical objects. It can be easy to get stuck on the plot we're going to make or quantity we're going to measure (because it is important, and crucial to our planning). This assignment is to practice pulling you back to the bigger picture - when we measure the apparent magnitude of something, what are we trying to learn about a system? (It could be distance, luminosity, period... and more!)\r\n",
